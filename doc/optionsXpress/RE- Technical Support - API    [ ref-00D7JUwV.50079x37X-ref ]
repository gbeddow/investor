I would like to download my account positions, open orders & transaction data so that, even if IÕm offline, IÕd be able to view, analyze, prepare tax data, etc. from the account data that was mostly recently downloaded into my application.I have no plans for placing orders via XML/API, just viewing & analyzing my account data.Why is there a minimum of 5 trades a month to use XML/API? I can easily see myself placing 1 Ð 5 trades a month, but not necessarily 5 trades every month.Cheers,Greg BeddowOn 9/11/09 3:11 PM, "Luis Bustillos" <lbustillos@optionsxpress.com> wrote:Hello Mr. Beddow,We appreciate you taking the time to send us this email and your interest to develop an API application.Before allowing you the use of our XML/API, we would first need to know a few things about how you intend to use this interface.  Can you please tell me what specific trading strategies you wish to utilize, along with your technical and software background?Also, please keep in mind that in order for you to be considered to use this interface, you will also be required to have a funded account and that you will not be able to incorporate any orders types that are not already available on our web site into your software.  You will also have to maintain at least a minimum of 5 trades a month.Lastly, we do not offer any development support if you should encounter any issues during the course of your implementation of the interface, nor do we offer a test environment. Any trades entered are real trades. Our API was configured for order entry and execution only. Please be aware that quotes cannot be pulled from our API; although, you may find alternative feeds that you can use to pull this type of information.If you have any other questions, you are welcome to email me directly and I will be happy to help.
